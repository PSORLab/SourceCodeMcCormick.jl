"""
    AbstractTransform

An abstract type holding possible transform options. Current options are:
- `IntervalTransform`: Only lower/upper bounds, results in 2x as many expressions/equations 
        (in simple cases)
- `McCormickIntervalTransform`: Lower/upper bounds and convex/concave relaxations, results in
        4x as many expressions/equations (in simple cases)
"""

    transform_rule(::AbstractTransform, ::Equation)
    transform_rule(::AbstractTransform, ::Vector{Equation})
    transform_rule(::AbstractTransform, ::Num)

Apply the desired transformation to a given expression, equation, or set of equations.
If the `AbstractTransform` is an `IntervalTransform`, all symbols are split into lower and upper
bounds, and the number of expressions/equations is initially doubled. `SourceCodeMcCormick` uses
the auxiliary variable method, so factorable expressions may be separated into multiple expressions
through auxiliary variables. If a `McCormickIntervalTransform` is used, all symbols are split into
lower and upper bounds and convex and concave relaxations. The number of expressions/equations
will thus be initially multiplied by 4, though additional expressions with auxiliary variables will
appear if the expression's complexity warrants it.

In either case, `shrink_eqs` can be used to progressively substitute expressions into one another
to eliminate auxiliary variables and shrink the total number of equations.
