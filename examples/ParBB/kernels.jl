Description: (OLD)
 Z is the epigraph variable that replaces the objective function. From the 
    lower bound of the relaxation of the objective function, we calculate
    that Z >= -0.668527. Adding in a slack variable, we get Z - S_1 = -0.668527. 
    But, this is inconvenient since the slack variable is negative, so we can 
    negate the expression above and instead calculate Z', where Z' = -Z. 
    Now we have Z' <= 0.668527, or Z' + S_1 = 0.668527. This is the first row
    of the tableau. 
Since we originally wanted to minimize Z, but have replaced Z by Z', we are 
    now minimizing -Z'. This is the second to last row of the tableau.
X_1 through X_3 are the problem variables, scaled to be on the domain [0,1].
    Since the tableau method assumes all variables are >= 0, we only need to
    include rows for the upper bounds. I.e., X_1 <= 1.0. Adding in slack variables,
    we get X_1 + S_2 = 1.0 (and similar for X_2 and X_3). This is lines 2-4
    of the tableau.
Line 5 of the tableau would not be created in this step, but shows an example
    of what the line will eventually contain. Here, it is a convex relaxation
    of the objective function, hence the 1 in the Z' column, and the subgradient
    information is stored in the columns for the X variables. This line can be
    obtained in the following way:
    Z >= -0.317476*X_1 + -0.449098*X_2 + -0.330095*X_3
    -0.317476*X_1 + -0.449098*X_2 + -0.330095*X_3 <= Z
    -0.317476*X_1 + -0.449098*X_2 + -0.330095*X_3 - Z <= 0
    -0.317476*X_1 + -0.449098*X_2 + -0.330095*X_3 + Z' <= 0
    -0.317476*X_1 + -0.449098*X_2 + -0.330095*X_3 + Z' + S_5 = 0
Lines 6 and 7 are reserved for future cuts. There may be greater or fewer lines
    dedicated to cuts for the objective function and/or constraints. In the pivoting
    step, these unused rows will be ignored until they contain useful information.
In this case, none of the slack variables were negative, so there was no need
    to use the artificial variable columns (A_1 through A_7). This information
    will be passed to the pivoting kernel, which will ignore these columns entirely.
The final row is for the Phase I objective, which is to minimize the sum of the 
    artificial variables. This is unnecessary in this case, as no Phase I solution
    is necessary and we already have a BFS comprising S_1 through S_5 basic.

And for objective function cuts, we have something like the following:
